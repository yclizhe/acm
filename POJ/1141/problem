Description
Let us define a regular brackets sequence in the following way:

1. Empty sequence is a regular sequence.
2. If S is a regular sequence, then (S) and [S] are both regular sequences.
3. If A and B are regular sequences, then AB is a regular sequence.

For example, all of the following sequences of characters are regular brackets sequences:

(), [], (()), ([]), ()[], ()[()]

And all of the following character sequences are not:

(, [, ), )(, ([)], ([(]

Some sequence of characters '(', ')', '[', and ']' is given. You are to find the shortest possible regular brackets sequence, that contains the given character sequence as a subsequence. Here, a string a1 a2 ... an is called a subsequence of the string b1 b2 ... bm, if there exist such indices 1 = i1 < i2 < ... < in = m, that aj = bij for all 1 = j = n.

Input
The input file contains at most 100 brackets (characters '(', ')', '[' and ']') that are situated on a single line without any other characters among them.

Output
Write to the output file a single line that contains some regular brackets sequence that has the minimal possible length and contains the given sequence as a subsequence.

Sample Input

([(]

Sample Output

()[()]
